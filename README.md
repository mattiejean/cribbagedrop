# Cribbage Drop (cribbaroni!!!)
Cribbage Drop is a game I created one weekend a few years back in order to learn ImpactJS. 
Cribbage is a game my family often plays together and I thought it'd be fun to make a 
drop style game where you had to match cribbage hands.

You can try it out at http://www.kleczka.com

The idea is that you have a set number of turns to score the hightest possible score.
First, select four cards that are adjacent by clicking on them.  Then, a crib card drops
and you are scored based on those five cards. Once the crib drops click the board again 
to start a new turn. It's not pretty or particularly fancy but it was a fun exersize.

The game was created with Dojo and ImpactJS.  The meat of the game logic is in "lib/game"
starting in main.js.
